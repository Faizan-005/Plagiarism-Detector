In recent years, algorithms that adapt and improve from experience have transformed the way software operates. By analyzing historical data, these systems can forecast trends, identify anomalies, and assist in problem-solving across sectors including logistics, education, and energy. Popular approaches include reinforcement-based strategies, ensemble models, and probabilistic inference. While they can enhance efficiency and accuracy, concerns about transparency, bias, and computational demand continue to limit widespread adoption.Machine learning enables computers to extract insights from vast amounts of information without being explicitly programmed.
