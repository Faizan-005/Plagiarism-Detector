Machine learning enables computers to extract insights from vast amounts of information without being explicitly programmed. It finds patterns and relationships within datasets, allowing systems to make informed decisions automatically. In industries like healthcare, finance, and marketing, machine learning supports tasks such as predicting patient outcomes, detecting fraudulent transactions, and optimizing ad campaigns. Techniques vary widely, from neural networks and decision trees to clustering methods and dimensionality reduction. Despite its potential, challenges like data scarcity, overfitting, and interpretability remain significant hurdles for practitioners.
